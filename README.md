**`Bugged Designer(Creator/Writer/Developer)`**

I am a Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Health Informatics _(BTECH | VIT Bhopal | 2021-25)_. I have lots of tricks up my sleeve. I am a front end web developer and content creator/writer. Recently I am more interested to build games using either plain JavaScript (DOM manipulation) or JS libraries (Kaboom, etc). I try to learn a thing or two from the web to polish my skills and prepare various projects.
